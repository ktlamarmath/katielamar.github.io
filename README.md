## About Me

I'm a 2nd year Bioengineering Doctoral Student at UC San Diego focused on improving brainstem Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) under the guidance of [Dr. Thomas Liu](https://cfmriweb.ucsd.edu/tliu/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Albert Hsiao](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/albert.hsiao){:target="_blank"}. My work takes both an acquisition-based as well as an AI-centric, correction-based approach to minimizing off resonance and motion related artifacts that significantly hinder the accuracy of brainstem functional imaging. 

Prior to joining UC San Diego as a Bioengineering doctoral student, I completed a Bachelor's of Arts in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science in May of 2022 and a Master's of Science in Electrical Engineering Computer Science (EECS) in May of 2023 at UC Berkeley. I also focused on minimizing cardiac and respiratory induced motion artifacts using microwave frequencies to track subject motion under the guidance of [Dr. Michael Lustig](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/?_ga=2.72174547.1906270088.1671994399-2113451694.1621362601){:target="_blank"} throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies at UC Berkeley. 

In addition to medical imaging, I have research experience in utilizing mathematical models to understand biological systems and I'm also very interested in mathematical oncology and biophysics. My current research interests include biomedical imaging, biophotonics, signal processing theory, biomedical signals, biomechanics, and biofluid dynamics.
